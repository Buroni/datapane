# Contributing to Datapane

## How is Datapane Framework developed?

Datapane CLI and library is an open-source product developed by the Datapane team - it is open-source, but generally not open to contributions right now.

To ease development we do most development within an internal monorepo and mirror changes to this repo directly as they are commited.

Our process for integrating PRs into our workflow is to close the PR to this repo, merge the changes back into to our monorepo, and then repush them back here - this may alter the commit hashes but not the history - ensuring that you correctly attributed for your PR and commits.

## Ways to Contribute

Whilst we're generally not open to PRs, we also recognize that contributing is so much more than just writing code.

If you'd like to just ask a question, show off what you're doing, or just hang out with us,
feel free to drop by our [forum][forum].

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Firstly, thank you!
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- That's great - it's always good to hear feedback and new ideas!
- Check to see if it's been discussed already in our [feature requests][feature requests]
- Open up a new thread in our [feature requests][feature requests], we can start chatting about your needs!

### Do you have questions about the source code?

- Ask a question on our [forum][forum].

### Do you want to contribute to the Datapane community?
