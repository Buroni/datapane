# Contributing to Datapane

## How is Datapane Framework developed?

Datapane CLI and library is an open-source product developed by the Datapane team and open-source contributors.

To ease development we do most development within an internal monorepo and mirror changes to this repo directly as they are commited.

We really value open-source contributions and PRs to this repo. Our process for integrating them into our workflow is to merge the PR to this repo,
merge the changes back into to our monorepo, and then repush them back here - this may alter the commit hashes but not the history - ensuring that you correctly attributed for your PR and commits.

## Ways to Contribute

Whilst this document is aimed at people wanting to work on the codebase, we recognize
that contributing is so much more than just writing code.

If you'd like to just ask a question, show off what you're doing, or just hang out with us,
feel free to drop by our Discord server or forum, found on our [community page][community-page].

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
