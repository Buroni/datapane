Once you have built up the blocks that make up your report, you can use one of the following functions to convert it into a report.

!!! note
    If your blocks include any App-specific blocks, e.g. `dp.Form`, you will not be able to output them as a report. Consider building as an app instead - see [here](../apps/overview.md)
