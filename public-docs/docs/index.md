Datapane makes it simple to build interactive reports in seconds using Python.

Import Datpane's Python library into your script or notebook and build reports programmatically by wrapping components such as:

- Pandas DataFrames
- Plots from Python visualization libraries such as Bokeh, Altair, Plotly, and Folium
- Markdown and text
- Files, such as images, PDFs, JSON data, etc.
- Interactive forms which run backend Python functions

Datapane reports are interactive and can also contain pages, tabs, drop downs, and more. Once created, reports can be exported as HTML, shared as standalone files, or embedded into your own application, where your viewers can interact with your data and visualizations.
