<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.

Please ensure you have read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

To ease development we do most development within an internal monorepo and mirror changes to this repo directly as they are commited. This means that most development is done internally - we are open source but unforuntely generally not open to contributions right now.

If you have found a bug, please open an issue or discussion. PRs are always welcome, however they may take time to merge and potentially require signing a CLA.

Thank you so much for your help!
